FarmVine is a groupchat platform built for farmers in Vietnam. Currently, farmers seek help in farming by face-to-face conversation with their closest peers. With FarmVine, farmers can talk and seek help from more fellow farmers across geographical locations in the group chat. FarmVine works on both smart and simple phones, with no Internet connection, and no software installation required. We envision FarmVine to be a platform for farmers to build networks they can trust each other, help each other, and empower each other
